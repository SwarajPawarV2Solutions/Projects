# Spotify Clone - Music Player (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This project is a **Spotify Clone** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It mimics the essential features of a music streaming platform, allowing users to play, pause, and switch between songs while enjoying a dynamic UI that reflects the currently playing track.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic UI**: 
  - The player changes the **background image** and **banner content** based on the song being played.
  - The **banner** updates with a new song title, artist name, and an image when a song is selected.
  
- **Play/Pause Button**:
  - A simple play/pause button that toggles between playing and pausing the audio.
  - The button changes its icon dynamically based on the current state (play or pause).

- **Track List**:
  - The project includes a table of songs where users can click on a track to play it.
  - Each song entry includes details like track number, title, artist, and duration.
  
- **Responsive Design**: 
  - The layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing a smooth user experience across devices.

- **Audio Controls**: 
  - The music is played via an `<audio>` element, and the JavaScript dynamically loads the song based on user selection.
  - Each track has its unique background image and banner that changes upon selection.

## How it Works

- **HTML**: The structure of the page includes a banner section, a song list with clickable rows, and an audio player element that handles the music playback.
  
- **CSS**: The page is styled with a dark theme that enhances the music listening experience. The layout is designed to be clean, minimal, and responsive, with images, text, and buttons properly aligned.
  
- **JavaScript**: 
  - The JavaScript code controls the logic for playing songs and switching between tracks.
  - Each song has an associated image and description that updates dynamically as the user interacts with the playlist.

- **Play/Pause Functionality**: 
  - The play/pause button toggles between playing and pausing the audio track. When a track is played, the corresponding background image and song details are updated dynamically.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the page with modern design principles, including responsive techniques.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic content updates and controlling the audio player.
